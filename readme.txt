Hi!

Following sites and tools were used:
http://seleniumdemo.com/
Python 3.8.2
Selenium 3.141.0
Webdriver-manager 2.3.0
Pycharm IDE

seleniumdemo.com removes accounts after unspecified period of time. If you would like to try and run a test make sure you run:
"test_create_account.py" first to create an account, it will allow other test to run.

Regards,
Michael
